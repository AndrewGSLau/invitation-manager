			</ol>
		</p>

	<h2>How to Download and Install the Invitation Manager?</h2>

		<h3>Installing the GC Invitation Manager</h3>
			<h4>Before you start</h4>
				<p><span class="strong">System requirements:</span> If your server is not using jQuery library version 2.2.4 or higher you will need to update this. </p>
				<p><span class="strong">A note about Staging and Production environments:</span> We recommend you follow this process for your staging/development website before duplicating this on your production website. If you do not have access to a staging/development website, simply go ahead and follow the same steps for your production website with the caveat that any changes made will be live on your site. </p>
			<h4>Upload files to your server</h4>
				<p>Copy and paste the “invitation-manager” folder (including its contents: InvitationManager.js, Overlay.js, Overlay.css, config.json, and im.json) anywhere within your web server. Once uploaded these files can remain on your website and will not affect your site performance. The visitor experience will only be affected once a pop-up invitation is activated.</p>
			<h4>Configure your settings</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Decide where you want to save the im.json file. Consider easy access for whomever will be creating/editing/removing the pop-ups. If you would like for it to remain in the invitation-manager folder, no action is required. Otherwise, move the file now.</li>
						<br />
					<li>Open the “config.json” file in the “invitation-manager” folder and locate the dbURL parameter. The value should equal the path of the “im.json” file that you determined in step 1.
						<br/>
						Example: “/invitation-manager/im.json”.
						<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>dbURL: "/invitation-manager/im.json"</code>
					</li>
						<br/>
					<li>Open the “im.json” file. This file is the data source of the Invitation Manager tool and where you will be able create, customize, activate and deactivate all pop-up invitations. This file will need to be updated with your departmental data and customized for your website. 
					<br/><br/>The “im.json” file is comprised of two sections:
					<br/><br />
						<ol type="a">

		<h3>Testing the Invitation Manager</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><span class="strong">Before you test</span>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify the hostname and/or page(s) you wish to test an invite on. This will need to be done on both your staging and production servers (we recommend it being a page with little to no traffic)</li>
						<li>You will need to create a “page” level and “site” level invite for testing. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br />
				<li><span class="strong">Steps to test:</span>
					<ol>
						<li>Publish test invite 
							<ul><li>

							</li></ul>
						</li>
						<br />
						<li>
							Generate html query string 
							<ul><li>
								Based on the test invites you created, modify the following URL query string to reflect the survey id and the scope type you inputted for your survey invite: <br />
								<code>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;?logim=1&im_scope=<span class="bg">page or site</span>&im_surveyid=<span class="bg">##</span>&im_nocookiecheck=1&im_nodatecheck=1
								</code>
							</li></ul>

						</li>
						<br />
						<li>Review page(s)<br />
							Open your browser and navigate to the page that you included in the <span class="strong">survey-urls</span>	 array of the invite and include the URL query string at the end: <br />
							<br />
							Example: <br/>
							
							<code>
								https://exampledomain.com/en/1.html?logim=1&im_scope=page&im_surevyid=1&im_nocookiecheck=1&im_nodatecheck=1
							</code>
						</li>
							<br />

						<li>Review the invite
							<ul>
								<li><span class="strong">Invite appears:</span>
									<ol type="a">
